# TrafficPrediction---UG-Project
Predicting speed of Traffic using Non-Linear Regression

This using Non-Linear Regression to predict traffic speed at various times of the day. It learns from past data and uses it to form an
equation. This equation is then used to predict traffic speed. It takes day wise as well as week wise granularity. It also has a GUI part
using the package graphics.py to create a simulation of a city. The project consists of three Machine Learning techniques:
Non-Linear Regression Technique, Kalman Filters, Regression Trees. These are then combined by the use of a Committee Machine
(Another Machine Learning technique based on a dynamic weighted average). I have shown here the code I have implemented, that is,
Non-Linear Regression, Committee Machine and the GUI of the simulated city.
